OrmEntity
  Has a tablename
  
   ParentRelationProperties
     (is an OrmEntityProperty -> OrmRelationProperty?)
      OrmRelationProperty has a "Relationship" field
      -> ParentEntity, ParentProperty  (an OrmRelationProperty)  has a PropertyName
      
      How do we go from ParentEntity to physical table name?
      How do we go from PropertyName to physical field name?
			We can look at the columns on the OrmEntity
			Try casting the property to an OrmFieldProperty and read the ColumnName
      
      Does that always link up to the "Id" of the parent?  I don't think so
      There is a "ChildProperty" field...
      
      
      
To try:
 * Initialize a project
 * Enumerate the relationships
