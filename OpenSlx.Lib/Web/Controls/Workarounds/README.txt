Temporary work arounds for stock controls bugs / misbehavior can be saved here.

For most of these work arounds the hope is that we will be able to remove them from
future version of OpenSlx (as the behaviors are corrected in the source controls), 
so they should be used with caution (e.g. with a different tag prefix so that they 
can be easily located).

As these controls are all intended to be temporary, this should NOT be used to add 
features to the stock controls.
